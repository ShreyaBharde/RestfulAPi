RESTful API for Data Management
This repository contains the source code for a RESTful API developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The API enables CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing data related to individuals, including their name, email, contact details, address, and an optional image URL.

Features
Express.js Framework: Utilizes Express.js for efficient routing and middleware handling.
MongoDB Integration: Integrates MongoDB for data storage and management, leveraging Mongoose for seamless interactions with the database.
CRUD Operations: Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data entries.
File Upload Support: Supports file uploads, specifically images, using Multer middleware, and stores them in the filesystem.
Security Measures: Implements security measures with Helmet middleware to enhance application security by setting various HTTP headers.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling middleware to catch and handle errors gracefully.
Environment Configuration: Utilizes dotenv for loading environment variables, enabling easy configuration of application settings.
